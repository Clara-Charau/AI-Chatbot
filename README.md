# AI-Chatbot
AI Chatbot for any type of use. Working with API.

To add an API go on https://aistudio.google.com/ then:
- Dashboard 
- API keys 
- Create an API key and create your project

Once you did all that, create a file in your folder and name it "config.js" and copy paste: 

export const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" by copy pasting the key from Google AI Studio.
You're done, enjoy !
